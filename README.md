## Data Job Surveys
The data was taken from Youtuber "Alex The Analyst," where he had his viewers take a survey revolving around everyone's different experiences with professional data careers. There are standard questions such as salary, location, etc. One question that stood out was, "How difficult was it for you to break into Data?" As someone pursuing a career in data, it's nice to see that others have experienced the same difficulty.

## What I learned
The purpose of this project was to use Power BI -- since I've learned primarily through Tableau, it's good to understand the other tools.
Using Power BI I learned:
- How to clean the data with this tool instead of Excel
- How to create an interactive dashboard

My favorite feature of Power BI is the "Applied Steps" Field on the right-hand side that keeps track of my actions. So, if I get lost, I can visually backtrack or restart from an earlier checkpoint altogether.
